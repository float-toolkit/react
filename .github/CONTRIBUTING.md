    mistake of your own.
1.  Make sure the issue hasn't already been reported or suggested.
1.  Fork and clone the repository, and checkout the corresponding branch (`docs` for documentation, `master` for anything else). **DO
    NOT** modify the `stable` branch.
1.  Make your changes (add or modify tests and documentation comments as necessary to cover your changes).
1.  Run `npm run build` (or VSCode task _NPM: Build_) to run the tests and build the package (you can use `npm link` to try it
    locally).
